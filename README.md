This is a [flipped form](https://flippedform.com) in plain English.  If something doesn't make sense to you, that's the form's fault, not yours.  Please [open an issue so we can fix it](https://github.com/indieopensource/support-contract/issues/new).

## Be Warned!

**Contracts are prescription-strength legal devices.  If you need terms for a deal, don't be an dufus.  Hire a lawyer.  A good one will ask good questions. They may decide this form fits your needs.**

**Do _not_ put confidential information about you, your work, or your clients in issues or pull requests.  Do _not_ ask for legal advice on GitHub, or try to disguise requests for legal advice as general questions or hypotheticals.  You don't want advice from anybody dumb enough to fall for that.**
